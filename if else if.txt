void main() {
  int num = 15;

  if (num % 2 == 0) {
    print('The number is even.');

    if (num % 3 == 0) {
      print('The number is divisible by 3.');
    } else {
      print('The number is not divisible by 3.');
    }
  } else {
    print('The number is odd.');
  }
}
In this example, we have a variable num with a value of 15. We use nested if statements to perform multiple checks.

The outer if statement checks if num is even by verifying if the remainder of dividing num by 2 is 0. If the condition is true, it prints "The number is even."
Inside the first if block, there is another nested if statement. It checks if num is divisible by 3 by verifying if the remainder of dividing num by 3 is 0. If the condition is true, it prints "The number is divisible by 3." Otherwise, it prints "The number is not divisible by 3."
If the outer if condition is false, meaning num is odd, it directly goes to the else block and prints "The number is odd."
You can modify the value of num and observe the different outputs based on the conditions.
